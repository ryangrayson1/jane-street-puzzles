'''
Expected number of steps to return home on soccer ball:

(where Ex is the expected number of steps when andy is x steps away from home hexagon)

E = 1 + E1
E1 = 1 + (2/3)*E2
E2 = 1 + (1/3)*E1 + (1/3)*E2 + (1/3)*E3
E3 = 1 + (1/3)*E2 + (1/3)*E3 + (1/3)*E4
E4 = 1 + (2/3)*E3 + (1/3)*E5
E5 = 1 + E4

Solving, we get E = 20

Thus, for the floor, we need to find the probability that andy does NOT 
make it back to the home hexagon in 20 or less steps.

To do this, we will find the probability that andy makes it back to the home hexagon
on the floor in 20 or less steps, and 1 - this result will be our answer.
